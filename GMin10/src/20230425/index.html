        <h1> <u> April 25th, 2023 </u> </h1>
        <p>
            Over the last month I managed to climb my way up to 970-ish on the chess.com servers before crashing
            back down to about 800. The rise can be attributed to playing particularly well for a few days, while
            the crash can be attributed to several things: Firstly, I got a little cocky with the strategy I had been
            using, and suddenly it wasn't working as well. Secondly, I was experimenting with different themes for the
            board and pieces (which had a larger effect than I was prepared for, but is temporary). Thirdly, I was
            experimenting with some risky little unwise strategies that definitely don't work past ~700 or so.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rise to grand master will be full of peaks and valleys, and I would characterize this peak as a something
            like a failed rocket launch: spectacular, thrilling, and not really a failure because it can be built upon.
        </p>

            I continue to imbibe lessons from some of the chess books I have been studying, and this continues to improve
            my game. I am a couple of hundred games behind on manually inputting games into the database, which has not
            been updated this month. However, over the next couple of months I will likely begin putting together a web
            scraping system to collect my data from Chess.com and Lichess in order to analyze it without having to
            input the data manually.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can't help but notice that this is all perfect for some programming projects, and I am now determined
            to build a chess engine from scratch. In the past I have experimented with genetic algorithms, and I
            think it would be a top notch project to create a relatively simple chess engine template with some
            variables and have variations on it compete within an ELO pool, using genetic algorithms to tweak those
            variations until they begin to do novel things. Although I will be including decision trees eventually,
            I think such an approach could yield interesting computer chess opponents well before the decision trees
            are very advanced. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Although many top notch chess engines exist, none yet exist which have been made by me. I am the kind of
            learner who learns best from fundamentals, and so building a decent little engine will make me a much
            better chess player while also giving me a chance to make something neat. I have begun on the first parts
            of it (I've made simple chess players before), but it will be a few more updates before it is anything to
            write home about.
