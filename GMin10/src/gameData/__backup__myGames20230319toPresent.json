An early queen trade (forcing his king to take and no longer be able to castle) set the stage for a positional game. He resigned after I took a hanging bishop, but had he taken either of the pieces I had left hanging I would have lost."},{"date":"20230320","opponent":"shizznitz","rating":779,"oppRating":701,"whiteOrBlack":"black","winLossDraw":"draw","opening":"richter-veresov attack","accuracy":67.1,"oppAccuracy":64.4,"easilyPreventableLoss":false,"gotLucky":true,"numTurns":36,"numBlunders":2,"timeControl":"rapid30","remarks":"a couple of hung pawns and a questionable bishop sacrifice almost cost me the game; managed to make a draw out of it with careful play; this was a case of getting lucky in the midgame, as if my opponent had not made two blunders I wouldn't have been able to secure a draw by agreement."},{"date":"20230321","opponent":"Timababa","rating":777,"oppRating":807,"whiteOrBlack":"black","winLossDraw":"loss","opening":"sicilian","accuracy":57,"oppAccuracy":74.3,"easilyPreventableLoss":false,"gotLucky":false,"numTurns":24,"numBlunders":1,"timeControl":"rapid30","remarks":"a tough game where my opponent played very well. one worth studying.

I'm still not sure why I do so well with the italian game when playing black, but I'll take it! A crucial rook sacrifice gave me the chance to checkmate, and since the opponent was playing well it took a little while to get. Good win! This game featured a rare kingside castle in the midgame after the f-pawn had been removed from the file, so it had a king's gambit flavor to it sort of."},{"date":"20230321","opponent":"emanuelionescu","rating":781,"oppRating":761,"whiteOrBlack":"white","winLossDraw":"win","opening":"scandinavian defense","accuracy":75,"oppAccuracy":43.1,"easilyPreventableLoss":false,"gotLucky":false,"numTurns":7,"numBlunders":1,"timeControl":"rapid30","remarks":"opponent played the scandiavian defense and it cost them the game. They resigned after a series of forced queen moves left a knight fork of the king and rook open. The chess.com analysis says I made a blunder here by not going for a queen trade, but I didn't consider it one and I won the game. At a higher level the trade would have probably been a stronger move."},{"date":"20230321","opponent":"Lafarce78","rating":789,"oppRating":825,"whiteOrBlack":"white","winLossDraw":"win","opening":"ponziani opening","accuracy":88.4,"oppAccuracy":68.6,"easilyPreventableLoss":false,"gotLucky":false,"numTurns":15,"numBlunders":0,"timeControl":"rapid30","remarks":"an early attack on the center worked out. took advantage of pins and tempo-gaining attacks on the queen to win. opponent resigned after I pinned their queen."}]
