# GM in 10

This is a little web page to track my attempt to reach chess grand master within ten years. Eventually it will be a fancier page, but for now it is pretty bare-bones.

Contained are some software tools I've written to track games and visualize data. They are in their infancy but eventually they will be pretty robust.
