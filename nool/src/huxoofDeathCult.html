        <h1><b>Huxoof Death Cult</b></h1> 
        <p><b>Overview</b>: A mysterious group of people throughout Nool focused on 
            <a href="onReligions.html">occult apocalypticism</a>. They
            are spread thin, rare, and don't coordinate much. Most people have never heard of them, nor will most
            people ever encounter them. One would need <a href="onSkills.html">Skills</a> such as 
            Hidden Lore (Occult, Conspiracies, or Magic) or a very high Streetwise to even know they exist. At any given
            time, a few members are in any major city. A few dozen small "off-the-grid" compounds in the wilderness likely
            host a few hundred more, throughout the whole <a href="kingdomOfNool.html">Kingdom of Nool</a>.
        </p>
        <p> It is not currently known what their underlying motivations, plans, and beliefs are. Only that they are
            dangerous, fanatical, and secretive. While their organization is not illegal (hard to ban what you aren't
            aware of), it does have a reputation for being the "wrong kind" of magic. Those who take issue with 
            <a href="onMagicAndPsionics.html">magic and the supernatural</a> in general point to boogeymen who 
            resemble cults like this one, whether they are aware of their actual existence or not.
