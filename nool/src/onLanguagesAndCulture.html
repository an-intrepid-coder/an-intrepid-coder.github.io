        <h1><b>On Languages and Culture</b></h1>
        <p>The people of <a href="kingdomOfNool.html">Nool Kingdom</a> all speak mutually intelligible dialects 
        of the Nool language. It is
        assumed that all player characters can write and read it. Not being able to do so is a 
        <a href="disadvantages.html">Disadvantage</a>, and any
        additional languages (there are uncountable ones out there) are an 
        <a href="advantages.html">Advantage</a>.
        </p>
        <p>As a fun little programming exercise, I am going to create name/word generators for each language and culture
        which arises in the game world. Each Wiki page will have a tool for generating random names, if the players
        want to do that. I am going to use these generators to pick all of the place and person names in the game
        universe (for the most part, anyway). I used the first version of the Nool name generator to pick the name Nool
        itself. It's very, very basic and results in a particular style of word. Generators for other cultures and
        languages will be tailored to look and feel differently, and I will refine the Nool one too. Eventually these
        little word generators will be pretty advanced (along with a number of other tools for generating NPCs and 
        navigating various tables that become relevant). As these are randomly generated words, they are not always
        very "good" words. I am going to make a point of creating a variety of "styles" here, but it will always have a 
        pretty "random" feel to it and be part of the setting's personality in that way. It would be
        a whole different level of challenge to try and randomly produce "good" words (as in, words which roll off the
        tongue well, or are easy to remember, or which line up with human linguistic expectations in general), and maybe
        I'll give that a try some day. For now these generators are only going to produce distinct styles for the sake
        of flavor, and naming NPCs and places on the fly.
