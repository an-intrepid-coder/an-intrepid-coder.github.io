        <h1>Street Thug</h1>
        <p><b>Overview:</b> A low-level participant in street-level urban crime. Usually working for,
            but not holding <a href="onRank.html">Rank</a> in, a criminal organization of some sort. Usually found
            extorting people, robbing people, mugging people, murdering people, acting as protection for more
            "white collar" criminals, and just generally giving the 
            <a href="townGuardPatrolman.html">Town Guard</a> a reason to exist. Although usually concentrated in
            specific parts of a city, they can be found in almost every major city throughout most
            <a href="onTechnology.html">Tech Levels</a>.

        <p><i>(Note that skill values include bonuses and penalties from traits. Defenses include bonuses 
               from armor. Relative skill level for Spell Skills includes Magery. As these are quick examples,
               individual instances of an NPC will have slightly different stats. "Quick" NPCs which become important
               characters will gain additional skills (and other things) when made full NPCs. These quick example
               NPCs only contain statistics for what is likely to be relevant while they are in play. Their 
               <a href="onPoints.html">point values</a> 
               thus mostly serve as an indicator of direct combat potential. More important NPCs may have a 
               lot of points in non-combat skills which specifically reflect their potential to influence the plot
               when their agenda is in conflict with the players, which isn't reflected as much 
               in the <a href="bestiary.html">Bestiary</a>.)</i></p>
