        <h1><b>On Character Builds</b></h1>
        <p>
            <a href="onTheCrisis.html">The Crisis</a> does not begin right away, and the
            way the characters fit into the world can affect how events progress. The players may find themselves safe
            from the danger for long periods of time and embroiled in other events. 
        </p>
        <p>Most 
            <a href="skills.html">Skills</a> will be 
            useful, but players should try to build a hardy group which can handle <i>some</i> combat. There will be many
            possible approaches to every situation, but characters should be prepared for travel, hardship, long periods
            away from civilization, and inevitable combat and hazards as a group. 
            Of course, the larger the party the more 
            specialized each character can afford to be. 
        </p>
        <p> While the GM will not <i>try</i> to kill the players, this is
            an apocalyptic horror campaign and it is possible for them to die. When that happens, players are encouraged
            to make new characters and join the party through some event contrived by the GM. 
            The campaign will carry on even
            if all players are killed, but the new characters may find themselves involved in a very different set of
            circumstances from the previous ones, in the same timeline, embroiled in The Crisis from a different
            angle entirely. 
        </p>
        <p> Since many supernatural abilities are locked behind 
            <a href="unusualBackgrounds.html">Unusual Background (Touched)</a>, it would
            behoove power-gamers to combine that background with one or more such traits. Although there is limited sci-fi
            at the start of the campaign, it will <i>certainly</i> feature later on in the campaign, and so space-related
            <a href="advantages.html">Advantages</a> and 
            <a href="disadvantages.html">Disadvantages</a> may be added to the starting lists at some point. 
        </p>
        <p> At some point, I will devise a number of <a href="characterTemplates.html">Character Templates</a>
            to assist players in picking rough archetypes.
        </p>

        <p><b>Regarding Power Gaming:</b> I wholly encourage it! Just keep in mind that most rolls will (probably)
            not be combat rolls. I encourage power gamers to approach the <i>entire</i> list of skills with their
            mindset, and to game out interesting combinations. Finding novel ways to use skills (combat related or
            not) to get through adventures will almost always result in some extra bonus points at the end of a 
            session. Players are encouraged to be creative and come up with non-standard cheese, using the skill
            system to come up with characters who can influence the game world. The GM (me) is happy to spend any length
            of time assisting with a character concept.
            Characters are encouraged to come up with new 
            <a href="perks.html">Perks</a> and 
            <a href="quirks.html">Quirks</a> if they want, even from the first session. Custom Advantages and 
            Disadvantages are also
            allowed, but will be weighed with more care. The GM has the final say on what's allowed, statistically.
