        <p><b>On Starting Equipment:</b> Characters should equip themselves according to the tables in Chapter 8 of the
            GURPS manual (pp. 264). 
        </p>
        <p> Cost of Living and Status requirements for rations and accomodations won't matter
            that much, but they may come up. 
        </p>
        <p> <a href="onWealth.html">Monetary</a> values will be expressed in terms of "Costs $X", but this will
            assume some amount of medieval coinage in 
            <a href="kingdomOfNool.html">Nool</a> (although it could mean other things in other societies).
            When/If players travel between economies, they will have to figure out how much of their wealth can even
            be spent in a new location. 
        </p>    
        <p> I will not quibble over the exact weight of coinage, but players are asked to
            use a little common sense here: a character may keep ~$10,000 in coins (presumably mostly of high
            denomination) on their person
            without having to worry about how much it weighs or how it is being carried. Much more than that
            will require some explanation, and large hordes of coin should be kept in a hidden safe or a bank, or
            invested in belongings. Bearing in mind that as events unfold the entire economy will be disrupted, at
            least temporarily, and players should be aware of this from the start. 
            <a href="advantages.html">High Wealth</a> characters should be built with this in mind, and players 
            should be creative about the forms that this wealth takes.
        </p>
        <p>For the start of the campaign, however, Nool has a robust and functioning
            <a href="onTechnology.html">TL3</a> economy and the players should buy starting gear from the manual. When 
            <a href="onTheCrisis.html">The Crisis</a> begins, the players will (temporarily, at least) find that
            their money is less useful and their personal belongings (and skills) more immediately important. That said,
            such characters will find themselves with tools that other characters don't have throughout the game, and
            points spent on higher Wealth for starting characters will not be points wasted even if it does somewhat
            shape the challenges/opportunities they will encounter.
