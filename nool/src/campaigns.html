        <h1><b>Campaigns</b></h1>
        <p> The first campaign I am going to run is a low-fantasy apocalyptic survival campaign, 
            taking place
            in a mostly medieval (rare magic) region. However, the setting allows for all tech levels, magic levels,
            psionics, and campaign genres to exist simultaneously (in particular if they occur
            on, say, different planets in different galaxies or something). Eventually, multiple campaigns in the
            same setting will begin to paint a dynamic and inter-connected picture that produces its own prompts for 
            continuation. My hope is that if the players should finish a campaign (or their characters die) that
            they might start new ones in the same world (but involved in different adventures), who encounter the
            changes their previous ones made in the setting, etc. Although most of the setting is low-fantasy,
            I have a lot of higher-TL campaigns in mind as well (which will be connected in the game universe).
        </p>
        
        <p>Having given myself a lot
            of latitude (read: <a href="onPortals.html">Portals</a>), even a campaign which poses an existential 
            threat to a large portion of the setting will not seriously disturb the potential for expanding it. This is
            important, because the first campaign will be a kind of "sandbox" where the spread of 
            <a href="onTheCrisis.html">The Crisis</a> will be along trade routes, roads, etc. (so the extent
            to which the game universe is altered by it is largely up to the players and the simulations).
        </p>

        <p> Although I'm primarily making this to play with some tabletop gaming friends, I am also a simulation
            enthusiast and some-time coder. There are coding and writing projects which naturally flow from
            making a project like this (for example, short stories; or scripts which instantly generate NPCs and
            encounters according to home-rolled tables which take care to work just as well using nothing but dice).
            To playtest for sessions with my friends, to refine the setting, to play with ideas, and just for 
            fun, I will run a lot of "simulations" in the background of the world between game sessions. Those
            simulations will generally be posted here for the players to enjoy, and for my later use (as writing
            prompts, story ideas, records of the setting's unfolding exposition, etc.).
