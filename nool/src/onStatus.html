        <h1><b>On Status</b></h1>
        <p>(pp. 28) Starting characters have a default Status of 0 (ordinary citizen), but can choose 
        anywhere
        in the range from -2 (downtrodden outcast) to 2 or 3 (minor nobility, etc.). High status is 
        only slightly more useful than 
        <a href="onWealth.html">Wealth</a> after the <a href="onTheCrisis.html">initial collapse of society</a>, but 
        may prove useful or interesting 
        in situations where survivors encounter other groups of survivors as pre-existing social tensions come to the 
        fore. In some cases the pre-crisis order will be respected by encountered survivors, while others may 
        use the crisis to settle socioeconomic grievances.
