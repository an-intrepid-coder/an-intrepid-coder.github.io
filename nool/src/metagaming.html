        <p> 99% of the stuff in this Wiki is common knowledge to at least <i>some</i> potential player characters,
            but some common sense is required. Players are asked to compartmentalize information and be good sports
            about it. When something in the Wiki is definitely not common knowledge, I will try to say so. Anything
            that I simply don't want the players to know under any circumstances just won't be put in the Wiki.
        </p>
        <p> In the future, I will experiment with levels of access for each page so that I can keep more complete 
            digital records without spoiling things.
