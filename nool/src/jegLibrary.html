        <p><b>Time Zone:</b> <a href="kingdomOfNool.html">Kingdom of Nool</a>
        </p> 

        <p><b>Overview:</b> Located within the oldest and most prestigious section of the 
            <a href="jegDocks.html">docks</a>, this institution is one of the oldest of its kind in
            the <a href="kingdomOfNool.html">Kingdom of Nool</a>. It is run by a head librarian who enjoys a special
            place in the legal codes of the city. Neither the <a href="jegMerchantsGuild.html">Merchant's Guild</a>
            nor any other group has the authority (or cultural clout) to push the head librarian around. That said,
            it's not an influential institution. Among the learned of Nool, people come from far and wide to study
            its books (and to copy books, and trade in tomes). Among the locals, it is a source of pride but mostly
            out of sight and out of mind. It is funded out of the taxes collected from <a href="cityOfJeg.html">Jeg</a>
            by <a href="fortressOfXiv.html">Xiv</a>, so that in the case of a dispute between the head librarian and
            the Merchant's Guild (or the <a href="jegTownGuard.html">Town Guard</a>) the head librarian can go over
            the heads of the other local authorities and appeal to the fuedal contract (the ruling family of Xiv have
            historically valued the Library and this is known). While the library is open to anyone and everyone,
            it is located in a relatively wealthy neighborhood and the ever-present town guard are quick to shoo
            loiterers away. This has given the library a minor stigma among the poorer residents of Jeg, who associate
            it with the ritzy neighborhood and its denizens. In practice, this means that anyone with 
            <a href="onStatus.html">Status</a> of less than 0 may need to take extra steps to gain reliable access to
            the tomes within (for study or any other reason).
        </p>

        <p> It is rumored among both the learned and everyone else in Nool that the Library of Jeg contains a vault
            with secret tomes and artifacts (possibly magical). Nobody has seen it though, and the head librarians
            have always laughed off such rumors.
