        <h1><b>On Technology</b></h1>
        <p><a href="kingdomOfNool.html">The Kingdom of Nool</a> is a bog-standard TL3 (Medieval) state, where technology 
        and science are largely stuck at a level comparable to ~1200 AD in Earth's history. 
        The game universe is filled with many
        such kingdoms, which form the bulk of human societies. However, there are isolated societies all over the
        game universe which exist at every tech level, from TL0 to TL12+.

        <p>If a character wishes to have access to
        <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a>, 
        <a href="skills.html">skills</a>, 
        <a href="characterCreation.html">traits, backgrounds, or knowledge</a> which aren't TL3 then they must take the 
        <a href="unusualBackgrounds.html">Unusual Background (Outlander)</a> trait, and come up with a home for their
        character. Fortunately, the possibilities are endless. 
        </p>
        <p>If a character wants to come from a TL much higher than 3 
        then they should probably come from beyond a 
        <a href="onPortals.html">Portal</a>. The GM is happy to help expand the game universe in order to enable
        concepts outside of the immediate lore I've provided (this was an intentional "out" in addition to being
        a neat world-building concept).
