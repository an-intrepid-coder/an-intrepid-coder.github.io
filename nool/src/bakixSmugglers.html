        <h1><b>Bakix Smugglers</b></h1>
        <p><b>Overview</b>: One of countless smuggling concerns operating out of the city of 
            <a href="cityOfJeg.html">Jeg</a>. This group of savvy thieves is known to have contacts within
            the <a href="greatForestOfGih.html">Great Forest of Gih</a>, which gives them their nickname of the
            "Bakix River Smugglers". In practice, they are small players in Jeg and mostly play a small role in
            helping people smuggle goods in and out of the city walls, to avoid tariffs between the 
            <a href="jegDocks.html">Docks</a> and the
            main roads. Most people have never heard of them. Only a character with the Streetwise
            <a href="skills.html">Skill</a> is likely to know they exist prior to being approached by them, and
            they are such small players in Jeg that one is likely to be approached by any number of other groups.
