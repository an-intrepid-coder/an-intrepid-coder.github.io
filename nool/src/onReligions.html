        <h1><b>On Religions</b></h1>
        <p>Many religions exist in the 
        <a href="kingdomOfNool.html">Kingdom of Nool</a>, from polytheistic to monotheistic, from
        formal to informal, from malevolent to benevolent. The state itself tends not to be very religious or enforce
        any particular religion, but religions are still powerful forces in the world and regularly affect society.
        </p>
        <p> Although <a href="onMagicAndPsionics.html">Magic and Psi</a> powers are very rare, they are common enough for 
        people to be confident in the existence
        of the supernatural (even if a Mage is only seen once in a few generations in a given city, that's more than
        enough), and this has led to an extremely diverse and unpredictable religious landscape everywhere in the game
        universe. Some kingdoms are run by zealots who enforce religious agendas, and there are even isolated 
        <a href="onTechnology.html">techno-states</a> 
        <a href="onPortals.html"><i>out there</i></a> who purge the supernatural from their borders in a 
        different form of religious zealotry. 
        </p>
        <p> The Kingdom of Nool
        has representatives of every conceivable strain of religion within its boundaries. Social conflicts around
        religion are very common even if it is very uncommon for the Nool state to take a hand in it. In this game
        universe, it's not unheard of for a cult or religion to have a powerful Mage or Psi pulling the strings (as
        religion is the main means by which people explain such powers -- including many Mages and Psis themselves).
        While it is not common for religion to play a major role in the 
        <a href="onPolitics.html">politics</a> of Nool, it is not unheard-of in
        general and is always a possibility.
