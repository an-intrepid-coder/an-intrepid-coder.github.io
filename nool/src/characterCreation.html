        <h1> Character Creation Details</h1>
        <p><b>Points</b>: 150 </p>

        <p><i>(Note that your typical "low level" combat NPC here is worth about 55 points of mostly combat-related
            statistics, while important NPCs capable of standing for or against the players may have 100+
            points in non-combat skills alone. Almost all "builds" will be useful. Focus on making interesting characters 
            first, and then use the 
            <a href="bestiary.html">Bestiary</a> and <a href="people.html">People</a> pages to compare 
            statistics. If a player wants to select
            from among the pre-existing NPCs in the game world then I will probably allow it but such characters 
            will be subject to the backgrounds and statistics already in play; though the player can evolve them
            further as they please. I encourage the players to create new characters with detailed connections to the
            game world that enable me to add more content to this setting. When faced with questions which aren't
            answered in this Wiki during character creation, the GM and player will engage in collaborative 
            pre-game world building.)</i></p>

        <p><b>Disadvantage Limit</b>: -50% of starting total </p>

        <p><i>(Note that some NPCs may have considerably more Disadvantages, and that I will
               generally allow players to treat these numbers as guidelines rather than hard rules in order to 
               enable interesting characters. The reason some important NPCs will exceed the 
               disadvantage limit is due to the fact that their inherent circumstances often demand 
               Duty (Hazardous; Involuntary), Secret (Fatal), Destiny (Great Disadvantage), etc. on top of any 
               other traits, which will matter in the game any time it is reflected in the statistics.)</i></p>
