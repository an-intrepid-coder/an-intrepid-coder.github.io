        <h1><b>On Wealth</b></h1>
        <p>(pp. 25) Default starting wealth (<i>Average Wealth</i>) is $1000. Characters may choose to 
        be wealthier,
        or poorer, but it's worth bearing in mind that this is an 
        <a href="onTheCrisis.html">apocalyptic survival campaign</a> and the characters won't
        have many opportunities to use their wealth after 
        <a href="characterCreation.html">character creation</a> (although you never know as the campaign 
        progresses). Characters who choose an above average wealth should invest it in things which will help them
        survive the initial collapse of society, and rebuild it after the disaster ends. So all levels of the Wealth
        trait are allowed but players should be pragmatic about it. If someone wants to put all their
        points in to a rich merchant who is suddenly broke because the systems of credit and banking broke down then
        that would be mostly for RP-flavor, and the GM will probably give a point discount unless the wealth can be
        used at some point later on (an interesting background idea). The starting region (
        <a href="kingdomOfNool.html">The Kingdom of Nool</a>) is 
        a <a href="onTechnology.html">medieval</a> society with some concepts of banking and credit, where most 
        deals are done with coins or 
        in-kind-transactions. A wealthy survivor will have to decide how and where their wealth is stored and
        what it represents before the game starts. Those details might influence the cost of the trait, depending on
        how useful the wealth is in the campaign. Is it land? Property? Valuable items? Gold in a vault? Gold in a bank? 
        Gold in many banks? Something else? Many possibilities. </p>

        <p><a href="onTheCrisis.html">The Crisis</a> doesn't care about your wealth, but survivors
        might. The Kingdom of Nool isn't the only economy in the game universe 
        (<a href="unusualBackgrounds.html">Outlanders</a> might even have come across paper money if they come from
        far away enough). Pockets of 21st-century-equivalent society do exist (but 
        <a href="onPortals.html">nowhere even close to Nool</a>) and it's
        not impossible for a character to literally have money in a digital bank somewhere. Since wealth can mean a lot
        of things here, the point cost will mostly be determined by how useful it is in the immediate starting 
        circumstances. This means an Outlander might have been the wealthiest person from his home region, but have no way
        of converting that money to utility in the Kingdom of Nool, which could mean several different things
        regarding the way GURPS handles wealth. This will be handled on a case by case basis.
