        <h1><b>On Points</b></h1>
        <p> It is important to differentiate between points which primarily reflect combat potential and points
            which primarily reflect plot potential. Players are encouraged to pick a large amount of skills and to
            carefully consider how they want their character to be able to influence the setting. Points spent on
            non-combat skills <i>will matter</i>, and adventures will in many cases be tailored to consider the skills
            picked. Not every adventure will involve a fight, but most (if not all) adventures will involve skill
            checks where the course of the plot (and indeed the whole setting) hangs in the balance. No consequential
            decision will be determined by GM fiat when it would be more interesting to have the players use a skill.
        </p>
        <p> Therefore, when perusing the point values I've used for NPCs, it is important to consider that I am using
            the same rules for them. When I run simulations where two NPCs are in conflict over a plot point, it is
            their skill levels and other stats which will determine how things go (for the most part, anyway). When the
            players must accomplish some non-combat agenda in the setting (think big: like influencing a whole town,
            or beating the bad guy to a specific location, or any other situation where the goals of the party are
            opposed to an NPC) it is the skills of both which will matter. As success rolls 
            and contests (like combat) are all about cause and effect in a measured and probabilistic way
            (see p. 171 for the % breakdown regarding 3d6 outcomes and skill checks), it is hoped that through
            being consistent I can allow long-term plotlines to procedurally generate and resolve themselves throughout
            the course of the game without having to take too arbitrary a hand as story-teller. This almost scientific 
            approach to building character statistics is one of the main selling points of the GURPS system, and it is 
            embraced here.
        </p>
        <p> So, if a player wants to get a good idea of what sorts of combat stats they should invest in then it
            would be best to examine the <a href="bestiary.html">Bestiary</a>, where are contained example "quick NPCs"
            with mostly combat-focused builds. A typical <a href="streetThug.html">Street Thug</a>, for example,
            is made up of about 55 points and is built for direct physical and social conflict. 
            This should be helpful for deciding 
            how "tough" your character needs to be in order to handle, say, being mugged; e.g. if you think your 
            character should be able to take on a mugger and easily win then you should probably invest more 
            than 55 points in combat-related areas (indeed, even the aforementioned stock NPC contains 18 points of 
            non-combat skills included in that number).
        </p>
        <p> <b>For <a href="onMagicAndPsionics.html">Mages</a></b>: consider that investing 35 points in 
            <a href="unusualBackgrounds.html">Unusual Background (Mage)</a> and <a href="advantages.html">Magery 1</a>,
            along with an IQ of 12 (40 points), only requires 20-ish points actually spent on magical spells to result
            in a character who can massively affect the setting and every single adventure with their "build". Considering
            potential <a href="disadvantages.html">Disadvantages</a> which offset the cost, this leaves a lot of points
            left to be spent on non-spell skills, attributes, traits, etc.
        </p>
        <p> Very few people in
            <a href="kingdomOfNool.html">Nool</a> practice magic full-time, and even fewer rise to the level of an
            archetypical fantasy wizard. Most magic-users in this setting use their spells to complement other
            abilities and skills. Players are welcome to make powerful wizards, but they will be outliers and
            capable of significantly altering the course of the game setting as events unfold. A character with, say, 
            Magery 3 and Explosive Fireball-16 (who is willing to use it in a street brawl) would not only be one of 
            the most accomplished mages in the land, but also be likely to upset the balance of politics and culture
            around them in the game. A likely outcome for that given example in most cities of Nool would be 
            attempted detainment by the authorities, who would then send for experts to figure out how to 
            deal with you. 
        </p>
        <p> Note that (with few exceptions) the cities of Nool have no laws against magic, but even
            among Mages there is a strong cultural taboo against using Magic to "get your way". Attitudes towards the
            supernatural have waxed and waned in the land over time, and the current balance is the result of having
            dealt with these issues before in the land of mythical, cultural memory. Even a "good" Mage who spends their
            life totally immersed in the study of the supernatural will harbor a cultural resentment towards the "wrong
            kind" of mage (represented as a boogeyman in the minds of most people). While very few citizens of Nool
            take issue with mages in general, <i>nearly everyone</i> takes issue with these boogeymen of lore, and
            the hallmark of such a mage (as every commoner raised on folk-tales will tell you) is that they are 
            able and willing to use their magic directly and publicly in a destructive or coercive way (although in
            different words, perhaps). 
        </p>
        <p> It is taken for granted
            that mages exist, but most magic users are subtle out of necessity; blowing up muggers is likely to raise 
            the ire of the public, the authorities, the criminal underground, <i>and</i> more
            discrete mages who resent the extra attention. Mages who draw attention to themselves risk drawing the
            interest of malevolent and benevolent forces alike, in any case. 
            So, if a player wants to put all their points in flashy spells (hoping to 
            blow away all opposition) then that is an option... but they should be prepared to be the center of
            a lot of attention which will quickly put them in situations that challenge their abilities more than
            the muggers they just blew up in public!
        </p>
        <p> In practice, this means that the
            <i>relative skill level</i> of magic-using NPCs in Nool is low even if their IQ is high... Even talented
            individuals find it hard to study their craft in an organized way because of the inherent social, political,
            religious, and practical difficulties of building anything like a "wizard college". NPCs (and player 
            characters) with even slightly higher relative skill values in spell skills (+2 or better) represent the 
            most learned and capable mages in Nool, because there is no way to gain spell-casting knowledge short of
            figuring it out yourself or apprenticing to a more powerful mage (if you can find one). Because of this,
            talented loner mages tend to also be experts in <a href="skills.html">Thaumatology</a>. 
        </p>
        <p> See
            <a href="magMaekh.html">Mag Maekh</a> for an example of a magic-user who would be considered typical of
            a "low level" but highly competent Mage in the Nool kingdom: she has only 16 points invested in spells
            which are best used with discretion, and her relative skill levels in them are mostly below 0. 
            In spite of this
            she has points in Thaumatology, because she had to teach herself everything she knows. This is a good
            guideline for how a "low level" mage that makes sense in the setting could be built.
