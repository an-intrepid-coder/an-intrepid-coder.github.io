        <h1><b>On Rank</b></h1>
        <p>(pp. 29) Rank is similar to <a href="onWealth.html">Wealth</a>/
        <a href="onStatus.html">Status</a> in that it provides only marginal benefits after 
        the collapse of 
        society (which happens early on in the campaign). However, as survivors encounter other groups of survivors or
        even try to rebuild portions of their world, people with Rank in various categories will naturally be involved
        in ways that suit their <a href="onTheCrisis.html">pre-crisis</a> position. So Rank can be a useful measure of 
        who in a community of survivors
        is taking the lead on what topic. Administrative, Merchant, Military, Police, and Religious Rank are all suitable
        for players to take. These roles exist in abundance both before and after the crisis begins! Similarly to
        Status, though, factions in all of these spheres may use the crisis as an opportunity to settle socioeconomic,
        <a href="onPolitics.html">political</a>, 
        <a href="onLanguagesAndCulture.html">cultural</a>, 
        <a href="onReligions">religious</a>, or other grievances. Such turmoil will affect players with Rank in 
        these spheres much more.
