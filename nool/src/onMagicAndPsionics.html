        <h1><b>On Magic and Psionics:</b></h1>
        <p>
            Magic and psionics exist but are very rare, being shunned by most and often mistaken for divine power. 
            <a href="onReligions.html">Cults 
            and formal religions</a> spring up around powerful mages or psionic individuals from time to time, and 
            very few
            people have any understanding of how any of it works. Most believe such things exist, but have never 
            encountered it. Most mages and psi-users are either loners trying to stay under the radar or have powerful
            connections on either side of the law keeping them alive. They are often working for the state, running the
            state, being persecuted by the state, or trying to destroy the state, as the case may be on the many worlds
            of this portal-spanning and mostly-medieval panoply of societies. In the 
            <a href="kingdomOfNool.html">Kingdom of Nool</a>, they are regarded
            with suspicion and are vanishingly rare although not actively persecuted by the state or most local religions.
            Any character seeking to be a mage or 
           psi-user must take an <a href="unusualBackgrounds.html">Unusual Background (Mage or Psi)</a>, and have a 
           backstory explaining their situation. However,
           as this is a fantasy world where magical powers abound, many supernatural traits are available for other
           characters to purchase (often requiring <a href="unusualBackgrounds.html">Unusual Background (Touched)</a>).

            Magic comes in many varieties, and some regions of the game universe have higher or lower mana levels.
            Some high-tech areas exist specifically in regions with no mana, where traditional spell-casting is
            impossible. So an <a href="unusualBackgrounds.html">Outlander</a> may or may not be familiar with magic,
            as the case may be.
