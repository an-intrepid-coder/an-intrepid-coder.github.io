        <h1> Nool World Wiki</h1>
        <p><b>Overview:</b> Nool is a persistent setting for GURPS (4th edition), which attempts to lay
            the groundwork for multiple campaigns within the same game universe while allowing for as
            many abilities and powers as possible, within a variety of campaign genre types. I am making this
            to play with some friends, but I've been wanting to do some serious GURPS world-building for awhile
            in any case and I'm going to go wild on this one. 
        </p>

        <p><b>Status:</b> Ready to begin whenever my tabletop gaming group wants to fit this one into the rotation.
            Will continue to fine-tune, run simulations, and add content in the meantime. Will likely use the setting
            as fodder for (shamelessly amateur) creative writing in addition to GURPS gaming. Many pages are not yet
            fleshed out, and many NPCs have not been added yet. As I run simulations and get a group together to play
            sessions with, the Wiki will expand with the results of those sessions and simulations. Even the
            world-building details of the characters the players make will expand the Wiki as well, as the game setting
            has been designed in a way that allows them to invent new locations from whence they came to begin with. Very
            early stages.
