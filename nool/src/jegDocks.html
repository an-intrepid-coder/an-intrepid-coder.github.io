        <p><b>Overview:</b> The bustling docksides which line the <a href="nemRiver.html">Nem River</a> as it snakes
            through <a href="cityOfJeg.html">Jeg</a> are the heart of the city. Most people who live here work at the
            docks, or cater to people who work at the docks. These docksides span several miles on both sides of
            the river as it passes through the city, and the city's shape is defined by the massive shipping and
            warehousing industries which have sprung up around them. While many parts of the docks are very safe,
            some are not. Bazaars, markets, shops, 
            <a href="jegLibrary.html">libraries</a>, inns, smithies, taverns, middle class neighborhoods, industrial
            zones, 
            <a href="jegTownGuard.html">Guard Barracks</a>, shrines, temples, jails, slums, graveyards, wealthy manors, 
            <a href="jegMerchantsGuild.html">Merchant's Guild</a> offices, and ancient family
            crypts can all be found in the docks. A 
            <a href="skills.html">streetwise</a> adventurer could spend an entire career in this area
            alone. Someone familiar with the area can generally find their way around from any given point to any other
            roughly known point within two hours, and often much less. Multiple bridges cross the Nem and connect
            docksides on either shore.
