        <h1>Lefyl Fog</h1>
        <p><b>Overview:</b> Lefyl Fog is an enterprising low-level representative of the
            <a href="bakixSmugglers.html">Bakix Smugglers</a>, operating in the
            <a href="cityOfJeg.html">City of Jeg</a>, age mid-20s. He is involved in a number of local rackets,
            and although not specifically wanted for any crime by the 
            <a href="jegTownGuard.html">Town Guard</a>, he is known to them as a member of the criminal
            underground (and if recognized, will be treated with suspicion). Lefyl is a competent operative in
            a variety of roles, and these days can usually be found running various schemes with lower-ranking
            members of his gang. He lives in and usually works out of the 
            <a href="jegDocks.html">Docks</a>. Lefyl is a "good worker" (such as it is within his profession),
            motivated by money and group loyalty. He's in good shape and can handle himself in direct combat
            (having had occasion to do so throughout his career).
