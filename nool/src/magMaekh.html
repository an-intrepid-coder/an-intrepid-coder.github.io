        <h1><b>Mag Maekh</b></h1>
        <p><b>Overview:</b> A small, quiet lady in her 30s. She is a member of the 
            <a href="huxoofDeathCult.html">Huxoof Death Cult</a>, residing in the
            <a href="cityOfJeg.html">City of Jeg</a>. She rents a room at a local inn, in a working-class part of
            town. She works at the same inn as a hostess, housekeeper, and occasional cook. Nobody is aware of her
            double-life as a death cultist, and she is in the city alone pursuing some goal in accordance with her
            cause. She is from a nearby hamlet but has lived in Jeg for many years, and is well-liked by her
            co-workers/co-residents at the inn. She generally minds her own business, and few note her comings or
            goings. She has been living and working there for many years. She is a genuine
            <a href="advantages.html">Medium</a>, capable of communing with the dead, although she does so without
            any advanced understanding of the cosmology or metaphysics involved. She often uses this power to justify
            her own <a href="onReligions.html">beliefs</a> as a death cultist. Whether she is hearing what she wants
            to hear from the dead or is being led by something from beyond is unknown (only other cultists, if anyone,
            would even know what she is up to).
        </p>
        <p> She is a capable but under-trained 
            <a href="unusualBackgrounds.html">Mage</a>. Although not one to engage in direct combat, she is capable of
            handling herself. She can use Movement Magic, Warding Magic, and Body Magic to fend off most 
            <a href="streetThug.html">thugs</a>,
            <a href="townGuardPatrolman.html">town guards</a>, or dangerous animals. She dabbles in Necromancy, 
            and is fond of using Death Vision during interrogations. Most of her 
            <a href="skills.html">skills</a> are related to her more mundane life as a working class member of 
            the Jeg urban economy. While she makes her living at an inn, she moonlights as a spy, guide, information-
            broker, and thief from time to time. Nobody is aware of her 
            <a href="onMagicAndPsionics.html">magic</a>, and she keeps her grimoire locked in
            a hidden safe within her room (often <i>magically</i> locked). If forced to use magic outside of the 
            privacy of
            her locked room, she prefers spells that can be cast discreetly. Victims of her spells may not realize
            they are being targeted by magic at all. Despite her potential, she is still a novice and her spells are
            not entirely reliable. Although she has practiced drawing her dagger quickly, she has rarely had occasion
            to use it, and prefers to avoid combat.
