        <h1><b>On Reputation</b></h1>
        <p>(pp. 26) Reputation may prove a more valuable currency than 
        <a href="onWealth.html">Wealth</a>, 
        <a href="onRank.html">Rank</a>, or 
        <a href="onStatus.html">Status</a> 
        during
        <a href="onTheCrisis.html">The Crisis</a>. Or, it may prove a bigger burden! The GM is going to carefully weigh 
        Reputations which can help or
        hinder the party's survival efforts at the start of the game, when considering cost. Players are encouraged to
        be creative here.
