        <h1>Hypek Zafit</h1>
        <p><b>Overview:</b> Hypek Zafit is a serious, portly, well-dressed man in his fifties. He is the head librarian
            at the (relatively famous) <a href="jegLibrary.html">Library of Jeg</a>. This position is hereditary,
            and Hypek has spent most of his life involved in the running of the library. He's well-connected in
            <a href="cityOfJeg.html">Jeg</a> and ejoys more <a href="onStatus.html">Status</a> and formal
            <a href="onRank.html">Rank</a> than most citizens of the city. He lives comfortably but is not particularly
            <a href="onWealth.html">Wealthy</a>, and lives in a house in the 
            <a href="jegDocks.html">Docks</a> which has been in his family for a very long time. 
        </p>
        <p> Few public figures in <a href="kingdomOfNool.html">Nool</a> are as openly knowledgable as Hypek regarding
            <a href="onMagicAndPsionics.html">Magic and the Supernatural</a>. This doesn't make him an expert,
            but when most people have less than zero knowledge on a subject then even a lone analytical dabbler becomes
            a subject matter expert to someone. Over a lifetime he has developed his own latent magical energies and
            would be capable of crafting his own grimoire of spells if he set his mind to it. However, his position as the
            head librarian (a position which demands his full attention and involves him in local politics) is the main
            driver in his life, and without some impetus he is unlikely to start learning spells. While it's known
            that he is knowledgable on the subject, and many suspect him of being a mage of some kind, nobody actually
            <i>knows</i> that he is so capable. 
        </p>
        <p>People who insist that he is in fact a secret sorceror of some kind
            are usually doing so in an effort to tie the library to some conspiracy theory, for ideological
            reasons (and not because they are aware that he could be, if he wanted to).
            He's a rational skeptic who takes an analytical approach to the supernatural. The few papers he's 
            written on the subject are well-regarded, if philosophical and lacking in practical applications.
