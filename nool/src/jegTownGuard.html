        <h1><b>Jeg Town Guard</b></h1>
        <p><b>Overview</b>: A well-funded police force of over 1,000 members. These fellows roam the streets on patrol,
            in small squads of 3-4, armed with swords and spears; typically clad in mail. There are investigative units 
            and
            secret police who deal with longer-term and more serious issues, but most people will only ever encounter
            patrol squads. The Town Guard is largely in the employ of <a href="jegMerchantsGuild.html">The
            Merchant's Guild</a>, although their ancient legal mandate is more vague and
            independent in theory. These folks often serve as the focal point in the ongoing conflict between the
            Merchant's Guild and innumerable smuggler organizations who flock from around the realm to subvert the
            infamous tarrifs of Jeg (for both fun and profit). As such, some guards are corrupt or are double-
            agents.
