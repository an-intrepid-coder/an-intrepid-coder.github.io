        <p><b>Allowed Racial Templates</b>: Only human, for now. Aliens and non-human species may feature later on. 
           Humans in this 
           universe, however, are numerous and infinite in their variety. Aliens, elves, dragons, etc. will probably
           pop up as the setting progresses. If a player really wants to make a non-human from the start, then the GM will
           figure something out! When The Crisis begins, affected creatures (the "Zombies") will be using custom 
           templates, and those templates will be listed here along with any playable non-human species which pop up 
           over the
           course of the campaign. It is possible, for example, that the party may fail the initial campaign and 
           "respawn" somewhere else in the game universe to handle The Crisis from a different angle
           entirely, using very different characters with different backstories. So, my intent is to start simple and 
           then give the players more options as the setting gets more
           complex. Elves, cyborgs, aliens -- all potentially possible. Perhaps they will even play "Zombies" at some 
           point? Who knows.
