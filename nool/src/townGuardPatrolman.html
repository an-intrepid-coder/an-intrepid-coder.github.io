        <h1>Town Guard Patrolman</h1>
        <p><b>Overview:</b> These are the people who patrol medium-to-large sized urban areas in roughly 
            <a href="onTechnology.html">TL3</a> areas. They are well trained but they are rarely exceptional
            fighters. However, they are usually armed with spears, chainmail, short swords, and daggers -- and can
            be a serious threat to anyone. They usually patrol in groups of 3+, and in a fight they prefer to use
            their spears and fight as a disciplined group. Because they have the advantage in the vast majority of
            conflicts likely to arise, they usually subdue and capture offenders rather than kill them outright. But,
            they don't usually lose any sleep over killing someone who attacks them (and a spear through the chest
            is usually quite fatal, even to a seasoned adventurer). In most places where they exist, they have broad
            legal enforcement powers and relatively little oversight on patrol. As a result, they can range anywhere
            on the spectrum of corruption and integrity. <a href="onMagicAndPsionics.html">Mages</a> are very rare in
            <a href="kingdomOfNool.html">Nool</a> and most of the <a href="onPortals.html">Portal Network</a>, and it
            is vanishingly rare to find Town Guard who are prepared for dealing with magic (or who have access to a
            Mage), although it does happen. They are not usually trained in throwing their spears, and almost always
            use them in melee as a group. The answer to a difficult situation for them is usually to bring more numbers 
            to bear.

        <p><i>(Note that skill values include bonuses and penalties from traits. Defenses include bonuses 
               from armor. Relative skill level for Spell Skills includes Magery. As these are quick examples,
               individual instances of an NPC will have slightly different stats. "Quick" NPCs which become important
               characters will gain additional skills (and other things) when made full NPCs. These quick example
               NPCs only contain statistics for what is likely to be relevant while they are in play. Their 
               <a href="onPoints.html">point values</a> 
               thus mostly serve as an indicator of direct combat potential. More important NPCs may have a 
               lot of points in non-combat skills which specifically reflect their potential to influence the plot
               if their agenda should be in conflict with the players, which isn't reflected as much 
               here in the <a href="bestiary.html">Bestiary</a>.)</i></p>
